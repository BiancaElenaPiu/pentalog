This repository contains my work on PHP programming for a practice program by Pentalog.

The folder is divided into five sections:

s1 – Covers a simple problem involving vectors and strings.

s2 – Focuses on classes and how they are implemented in PHP.

s3 – Includes two small projects: a minimal calculator and a basic login-register system.

s4 – Contains a more advanced and refined version of the login-register system.

s5 – An unfinished project related to the Laravel framework.
